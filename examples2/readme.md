# Developing with type hints

## generating type stub.

In this directory, there is a type stub `schemas.pyi`

```python
from typing import Sequence, Union
from datetime import date, datetime, time, timedelta

from bqsc import Table

class MyTable(Table):
    col_str: Union[str, Sequence[str]]
    col_int: Union[int, Sequence[int]]
    col_float: Union[float, Sequence[float]]
    ...
```

The file can be generated by executing 

```shell
$ bqsc dir jsons
```

## generating class implementation

`schema.py` is the implementation for the above stub, whose content is as following.

```python
import bqsc

globals().update(bqsc.load_dir("./jsons"))
```

This may not look like implementing a class. Please read my [another story](This may not look like implementing a class. Please read my another story in medium.com for how it works
) in medium.com for how it works

## coding with type stubs

`main.py` is a typical use case. 

1. Instanciate a class
2. Set values for each properties. Writing these code, IDE helps you typing property names and checks type statically
3. Convert the object into pandas.DataFrame
